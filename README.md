# Colab-Notebook-Archive

Some of my miscellaneous Colab notebooks that might be of interest to others.

* [Email_Link_in_Colab](https://github.com/pbeens/Colab-Notebook-Archive/blob/main/Email_Link_in_Colab.ipynb) — A quick notebook I created to remind me how to insert working email links with the subject. For teachers creating Colab notebooks as assignments (which is a good idea, BTW), modify the subject so it reflects the assignment name.
* [Python_Sort_List_Disregarding_Case](https://github.com/pbeens/Colab-Notebook-Archive/blob/main/Python_Sort_List_Disregarding_Case.ipynb) — I had to figure out how to sort a list that had a combination of cases. This was the solution.
