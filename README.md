Some of my Colab notebooks that might be of interest to others.

* [Ambiguous_PEMDAS_Solved!](https://github.com/pbeens/Colab-Notebook-Archive/blob/main/Ambiguous_PEMDAS_Solved!.ipynb) — A fun look at a math problem that appeared in various social media.
* [Current_Ontario_COVID_Data](https://github.com/pbeens/Colab-Notebook-Archive/blob/main/Current_Ontario_COVID_Data.ipynb) — Some Python code that was created using the OpenAI website, with some recommended activities to try.
* [Distance_Between_Two_Points](https://github.com/pbeens/Colab-Notebook-Archive/blob/main/Distance_Between_Two_Points.ipynb) — `math.dist()` doesn't work in Colab so here's my version
* [Email_Link_in_Colab](https://github.com/pbeens/Colab-Notebook-Archive/blob/main/Email_Link_in_Colab.ipynb) — A quick notebook I created to remind me how to insert working email links with the subject. For teachers creating Colab notebooks as assignments (which is a good idea, BTW), modify the subject so it reflects the assignment name.
*  [Lighthouse_Labs_CSV_Downloader.ipynb](https://github.com/pbeens/Colab-Notebook-Archive/blob/main/Lighthouse_Labs_CSV_Downloader.ipynb) — Created this to download data files from the [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/) challenges. Can be used for other Jupyter notebook sites as well.
*  [Lighthouse_Labs_SQL_Downloader.ipynb](https://github.com/pbeens/Colab-Notebook-Archive/blob/main/Lighthouse_Labs_SQL_Downloader.ipynb) — Created this to download non-CSV files from [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/) challenges.
* [Math_Coding_Glossary_(Ontario)](https://github.com/pbeens/Colab-Notebook-Archive/blob/main/Math_Coding_Glossary_(Ontario).ipynb) — Created to support math teachers on Ontario that want to learn programming.
* [Math_in_Python_(Demo,_Ties_to_Curriculum,_Resources)_August_2021](https://github.com/pbeens/Colab-Notebook-Archive/blob/main/Math_in_Python_(Demo%2C_Ties_to_Curriculum%2C_Resources)_August_2021.ipynb) — This was a presentation Grant Hutchison and I put on for Ontario Grade 9 math teachers.
* [Python_Saving,_Loading,_and_Plotting_Dictionary_Data](https://github.com/pbeens/Colab-Notebook-Archive/blob/main/Python_Saving%2C_Loading%2C_and_Plotting_Dictionary_Data.ipynb) — I had a need to save and reload some dictionary data. This was the solution I discovered, using NumPy.
* [Python_Sort_List_Disregarding_Case](https://github.com/pbeens/Colab-Notebook-Archive/blob/main/Python_Sort_List_Disregarding_Case.ipynb) — I had to figure out how to sort a list that had a combination of cases. This was the solution.
* [Web_Scraper_Template_(Using_Selenium)](https://github.com/pbeens/Colab-Notebook-Archive/blob/main/Web_Scraper_Template_(Using_Selenium).ipynb) — My go-to template for when I have to scrape a complicated webpage. Beautiful Soup can be used for simple pages.
* [Sort_lines_by_line_length](https://github.com/pbeens/Colab-Notebook-Archive/blob/main/Sort_lines_by_line_length.ipynb) — Want to use Python  to sort lines of text by line length? Here's a tutorial I created using Bing Chat that shows beginner and advanced ways to do it.
